General Concept:
 Product Description 
i.  Product Description:  Application which monitors a storeâ€™s capacity real-time and has an online ordering/pickup feature.
ii.  Who is the client:  We have two users/clients that will benefit from our program:
Store Managers: 
Who are they:  Owners of the store in charge of the total business operations and meeting local regulations. 
How does this application benefit them:  This application will assist to have an automated system to allow store managers to see the use condition of their store in real time.  This means how many people are entering/leaving the store, and how many are within the store at a given time.  This feature is very helpful for a business to monitor trends and adjust their business model to maximize its output.  Also this application is seeking to streamline the buying process so that shoppers can place orders and pickup.  This exponentially reduces the congestion in the store, the time at store, but increases total sales.  There is an added perk during a time of a pandemic.  With COVID19 restrictions from local governments, the governments are putting the impossible task for store owners to manage the capacities in real time.  This is almost impossible to do without an automated real-time monitoring system.
Private Citizens:
Who are they: Visitors and purchasers of the store.
How does this application benefit them:  This application will allow a citizen to know the real-time capacity condition of a store.  This is very helpful to maximize a users efficiency or in the case of COVID19 to help those with immuno-compromised conditions make the best plan for their health.  Also this application goes even further to allow online shopping from home with the ease of pickup.  This greatly reduces the time needed for the citizen to get groceries and completely eliminates the need to go in the store as pickup is outside.
